# SecretSanta
An command line application that selects secret santas, keeping them secret by flooding the command line with text.

.csv file must be named "SantasList.csv". The CommandLineInterface class contains a method called "extractFromCSV", you can change the desired .csv name and path here.

The project uses random number generation to select pairs, but depending on which order santas are picked, there might be a higher probability of getting some people over others.
